                <p>
                    This Privacy Policy describes how the LinkedIn Automation Tool (the "Tool"), which operates within a Google Sheet via Google Apps Script, collects, uses, and handles your information when you use it to interact with the LinkedIn and Google APIs. This Tool is for personal use only and is managed by you.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 border-b pb-2">Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>
                    The Tool accesses the following information via secure API connections, but only after you provide explicit authentication and permission:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-4">
                    <li><strong>From LinkedIn:</strong> Your basic profile information (specifically your unique Person URN to identify you as the author of posts), and analytics data for posts created by the Tool (such as impression, like, and comment counts).</li>
                    <li><strong>From Google:</strong> The content you provide within your private Google Sheet (such as topics and prompts) and the ability to create a "LinkedIn Bot Images" folder in your Google Drive to store generated images.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 border-b pb-2">How We Use Your Information</h2>
                <p>
                    Your information is used exclusively to perform the functions of the Tool as intended:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-4">
                    <li>To automatically generate post captions and images based on your prompts.</li>
                    <li>To publish content to your LinkedIn profile on your behalf at scheduled times.</li>
                    <li>To retrieve performance analytics for the content it posts.</li>
                    <li>To store generated images in your personal Google Drive for inclusion in posts.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 border-b pb-2">Data Storage and Sharing</h2>
                <p>
                    All data collected and processed by the Tool is stored securely within your own Google Account (in a private Google Sheet and a folder in your Google Drive).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>We do not share your information with any third parties.</strong> The Tool does not have an external database, and all data remains under your control in your Google ecosystem. Your API keys and access tokens are stored securely within the Google Apps Script environment associated with your sheet.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 border-b pb-2">Your Control</h2>
                <p>
                    You have complete control over the Tool and your data. You can stop the Tool at any time by deleting the triggers or the script from your Google Sheet. You can also revoke API access tokens from your LinkedIn and Google account settings.
                </p>
